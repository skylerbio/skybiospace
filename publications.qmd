Friedline S, Madill MW, Waring KR, Hallam SJ, Ziels RM. *IWA World Conference on Anaerobic Digestion* (2024). Oral Presentation.

This was my first opportunity to publicly present the research that formed my M.Sc. thesis. I am very excited about these results and look forward to a peer-reviewed article being available very soon!

(* indicates co-first authors)

This was my first (co-)first author publication! We collaborated between labs within the CUBES organization to develop a serial culture method for producing 3D printing materials in a resource-limited context.

At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, I had the opportunity to volunteer my time and energy to the rapid establishment of a Covid testing clinic on the UC Berkeley campus. I was fortunate enough to work alongsides some of the brightest minds at this institution and contributed to the design and deployment of a clinical Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) used to track samples through an automated processing workflow and report results to clinicians.
